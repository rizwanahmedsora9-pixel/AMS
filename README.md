# AMS — Ahmed Management System

Flask + SQLAlchemy (SQLite) ERP for a cement / building-materials business:
direct sales and bookings, stock and GRN, dispatch, delivery persons and
rentals, clients / suppliers, chart of accounts, cash flow and reconciliation,
financial ledgers, reports and PDF exports, Excel import / export, plus admin,
permissions and data-maintenance tooling.

`wsgi.py` is the production entry point; `main.py` is the local development
server. A signed PythonAnywhere deployment webhook is available through
`wsgi.py` (see "Deployment" below).

## Stack

| Area | Technology |
|---|---|
| Web | Flask 3, Flask-Login, Flask-SQLAlchemy |
| ORM / DB | SQLAlchemy 2, SQLite (`instance/ahmed_cement_v44_fresh.db`, schema **v4.4**) |
| Data | pandas, numpy (&lt;2), openpyxl |
| PDF | WeasyPrint (primary) with ReportLab fallback (`app/services/pdf_fallback.py`) |
| Front end | Jinja2, Bootstrap 5.3, Bootstrap Icons, Flatpickr (vendored in `static/vendor`) |
| Tests | pytest (`pytest.ini`) |

Schema source of truth is the **ORM** (`db.create_all()` + column/index helpers
in `app/services/schema.py`). There is no `v44/SCHEMA_v4_4.sql` file; boot logs
a warning and continues. Versioned SQL in `app/migrations/` (`NNNN_*.sql`) runs
automatically on every start via `app/services/auto_migrate.py`.

## Getting started

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py            # 0.0.0.0:5000
```

WeasyPrint needs `pango`, `cairo` and `gdk-pixbuf`. When they are missing
(common on shared hosts) PDF downloads fall back to ReportLab.

Default first-run admin (empty DB): `Admin` / `Admin@fbm12345`. Change it.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `5000` | Dev server port |
| `AMS_DEBUG` | unset | `1` enables the Werkzeug debugger in `main.py` |
| `APP_DB_PATH` | `instance/ahmed_cement_v44_fresh.db` | SQLite path |
| `AMS_SCHEMA_VERSION` | `v44` | Runtime schema (`v44` only) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | generated into `instance/secret_key` | Session signing |
| `AMS_HTTPS` | unset | `1` for secure / `SameSite=None` cookies |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `256` | Upload size limit |
| `SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE` | auto | `DELETE` is forced on PythonAnywhere (no POSIX shm for WAL) |
| `ALLOW_EMPTY_DB` | `1` | Missing DB is a valid first run |
| `MIGRATIONS_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE` | `0` | Permit `DROP`/`DELETE` in SQL migration files |

---

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

Regression coverage for the old PRED defects (concurrent bill numbers,
future-dated payments, Open-Khata visibility/settlement, CSRF on all mutating
routes, sale idempotency, reconciled-period guard, wipe FK order, SQL-leak
flashes, `check_bill` auto bills, stock/bill/receivable blind spots) lives in
`tests/test_predator_regressions.py`. Schema/import, full-DB snapshots,
auto-migrations, wipe, ledgers/PDF and login have their own modules.

---

## What is already solid (vs the old audits)

Do **not** re-open these as if they were still broken:

| Area | Current behaviour |
|---|---|
| Empty production DB | First-run bootstrap is supported; full data moves via SQLite snapshots |
| Hardcoded webhook token / wrong GitHub repo in `main.py` | Removed. The replacement uses a server-only secret and a signed WSGI webhook; `main.py` stays a local server |
| CSRF | Session CSRF on **every** mutating endpoint (`app/hooks.py`); no webhook skip remains |
| Duplicate auto bill numbers | `get_next_bill_no` takes the SQLite write lock first |
| Future-dated money | Payments and reconciliation dates in the future are rejected |
| Open Khata | `ensure_open_khata_client()` seeds a real master; receivables show and settle |
| Domain wipe FK order | Sale lines unlink `grn_item_id` before GRN lots are deleted |
| Sale forms | Add/edit fields match the backend; missing-field scare was not confirmed |
| Import FK / blank bill uniqueness | Parent-first insert; unique auto-bill indexes ignore blanks |
| Data transport | Full moves use `.amsdb` SQLite snapshots (`full_db_sync/`), not Excel |
| Schema going forward | Numbered SQL migrations apply on every boot |

Sale, booking, payment, GRN, stock, ledger and wipe paths are exercised by
pytest. The predator truth engine (`tools/predator_truth_engine.py`) can still
be run against a copy of a live DB for an independent raw-SQL check.

---

## Data: load, snapshot, migrate

**Day-to-day full copy** (recommended): Import / Export Center →
**Full Database Snapshot (.db)**. Export produces `AMS_FULL_<ts>.amsdb`.
Import backs up the live file, wipes rows (schema stays), copies source rows
with original IDs, then runs `integrity_check` + `foreign_key_check` +
row-count parity.

CLI (same engine, no Flask required):

```bash
python -m full_db_sync export --db instance/ahmed_cement_v44_fresh.db
python -m full_db_sync verify --db AMS_FULL_xxx.amsdb
python -m full_db_sync import --source AMS_FULL_xxx.amsdb \
    --db instance/ahmed_cement_v44_fresh.db --confirm
```

Details: `full_db_sync/README.md`.

**Dummy dataset:** `dummy_data/README.md` (full XLSX for the legacy full-raw
importer). Prefer `.amsdb` for real full-data moves.

**Old-format `ahmed_cement.db`:** the snapshot importer **refuses** it (missing
v4.4 columns) before touching the target. Convert with the external migrate
tool, then import the resulting v4.4 file. The XLSX pipeline under
`tools/migrate/` is **superseded** (kept for old `ALLEXPORT` workbooks). An
“opening balances only” migration was proposed and **never built** — live
path is full-history SQLite.

**Adding schema later:** drop `app/migrations/0002_short_name.sql` (never edit
an already-applied file). See `app/migrations/README.md`.

---

## Deployment

The replacement is `deploy_hook.py`, mounted by `wsgi.py` at `/deploy`.
It uses only Python's standard library on Linux/PythonAnywhere. A signed GitHub
push to the configured branch runs `git pull --ff-only origin <branch>` and
touches the PythonAnywhere WSGI file to request a reload. No API token,
GitHub Actions workflow, scheduler, or Flask CSRF exemption is required.

### Install and configure with `setup_Deploy.py` (recommended)

`setup_Deploy.py` is a single-file, standard-library installer for this deployment.
It can bootstrap a fresh account, repair a broken one, and verify a working one. It
never imports the Flask application, never starts a second server, and never touches
the database files.

Obtain it in one of two ways:

* download the raw file from the repository (this works before a merge too, but the
  branch must contain the file):

  ```bash
  # use main once this change is merged; until then use the branch that contains it
  curl -fsSL -o ~/setup_Deploy.py \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rizwanahmedsora9-pixel/AMS/main/setup_Deploy.py
  ```

* or copy it from a checkout you already have (`cp /path/to/AMS/setup_Deploy.py ~/`).

Run it in a **PythonAnywhere Bash console** on the production account:

```bash
cd /home/rehmanahmed        # the production checkout; there is no AMS subfolder
python3 setup_Deploy.py     # guided: prints a plan and asks before material changes
```

It defaults to `--target /home/rehmanahmed`, `--repo
https://github.com/rizwanahmedsora9-pixel/AMS.git`, `--branch main` and
`--domain rehmanahmed.pythonanywhere.com`; `--target/--repo/--branch/--domain`
override those for a different account or a staging copy.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 setup_Deploy.py --check-only` | inspects and validates only, writes nothing (safe on a live site) |
| `python3 setup_Deploy.py --dry-run` | prints the plan and every command it would run, changes nothing |
| `python3 setup_Deploy.py --yes` | unattended run: confirms the material changes it would normally ask about |
| `python3 setup_Deploy.py --show-secret` | prints the webhook secret once, privately, for the GitHub box |
| `python3 setup_Deploy.py --restore-installer-file` | archives a locally edited `setup_Deploy.py` and restores the tracked copy |
| `python3 setup_Deploy.py --help` | all options (python, venv, wsgi file, retries, timeouts, skip-…) |

Exit codes: `0` everything required is done, `2` done except the listed manual steps,
`1` blocked/failed — so a script can tell "needs a human" from "broken".

#### What the installer does automatically

* Inspects first and prints what it found: checkout, origin, branch, local edits,
  hook, WSGI file, secret, virtualenv, requirements, SQLite files, existing state.
  It never assumes the home directory is empty.
* Bootstraps the home-directory checkout (`git init`, `remote add`, `fetch`,
  `checkout -b <branch> --track origin/<branch>`) and adds the `*` rule to
  `.git/info/exclude` so unrelated account files stay invisible to Git.
* Archives whatever `setup_Deploy.py` already sits in the checkout into
  `<checkout>/instance/setup/backups/<timestamp>/downloaded--setup_Deploy.py`
  before the checkout can replace it, and copies any account file that a tracked
  AMS path would overwrite (with a manifest), asking before continuing.
* Updates an existing checkout with `git fetch` + `git merge --ff-only origin/<branch>`.
  It never runs `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git stash`, or a forced checkout;
  modified tracked files stop the update and are reported instead of discarded.
* Creates or reuses `/home/rehmanahmed/.venv` (using the same Python version as the
  Web app) and installs `requirements.txt` with that virtualenv's own Python.
  Transient network failures are retried a bounded number of times; real errors are
  reported with pip's message.
* Creates `instance/deploy_secret.txt` with `secrets.token_hex(32)` and mode `0600`,
  keeps a valid existing secret (only tightening the mode), and rotates only when you
  ask (`--rotate-secret`) or confirm. Git history is checked for the previously
  committed secret and a stale root-level copy is offered for quarantine.
* Writes exactly one managed block into the WSGI file shown in the Web tab:

  ```python
  # >>> AMS deployment setup (managed by setup_Deploy.py) >>>
  ...
  os.environ["AMS_WSGI_FILE"] = "/var/www/rehmanahmed_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py"
  os.environ["AMS_DEPLOY_BRANCH"] = "main"
  os.environ.setdefault("SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE", "DELETE")
  os.environ.setdefault("AMS_HTTPS", "1")
  from wsgi import application
  # <<< AMS deployment setup (managed by setup_Deploy.py) <<<
  ```

  Everything outside the markers is preserved (host setup, a custom `APP_DB_PATH`,
  deliberate overrides). The file is backed up first, validated as Python before
  writing, and the block is replaced rather than duplicated on later runs. A
  hand-written AMS import is adopted only after a confirmation, keeping the old line
  as a comment; another application's WSGI file is refused untouched, and the
  installer never guesses a WSGI file name that does not exist.
* Verifies in stages (files installed → virtualenv/dependencies → secret → WSGI
  configured → site reachable → `/deploy/health` → signature accepted/unsigned
  rejected → webhook → real push→pull), and writes a redacted log and report under
  `<checkout>/instance/setup/`.

#### What still needs you (authentication or manual action)

* **Web app settings.** With a PythonAnywhere API token (`export API_TOKEN=…`,
  or `--api-token-file`) the installer reads the Web tab configuration and updates
  source directory/working directory, virtualenv, Python version and the `/static/`
  mapping through the documented API, then reloads. Without a token it changes
  nothing and prints the exact Web tab steps: Source code and Working directory
  `/home/rehmanahmed`, virtualenv `/home/rehmanahmed/.venv`, `/static/` →
  `/home/rehmanahmed/static`. Creating a web app through the API depends on the
  account type — if it is refused, the installer says so and prints the manual steps.
* **The GitHub webhook.** With a token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`, the `gh` CLI, or
  `--github-token-file`) it creates or verifies the webhook
  (`https://rehmanahmed.pythonanywhere.com/deploy`, content type
  `application/json`, push events only, SSL verification on, secret from the server
  file) and pings it to confirm a `200`/`pong`. Without a token it prints the
  two-field GitHub form. An existing webhook is never duplicated and its secret is
  never changed unless you pass `--update-webhook`.
* **The first real push.** Only a signed push → pull → reload proves the pipeline.
  The installer deliberately does not create a commit to test it; push a commit to
  the deployed branch and check *Recent Deliveries* for `Deployed <sha>; WSGI reload
  requested`.
* **Secrets.** Tokens come from the environment, a `0600` file, or a hidden prompt —
  never from chat, never into Git, never into the log or report (only fingerprints).
  `--show-secret` is the one explicit, private display step for pasting the secret
  into GitHub; clear the screen afterwards.

#### Rerun, recovery and troubleshooting

* Every run is safe to repeat: it re-detects the state, keeps the existing secret and
  virtualenv, and rewrites the WSGI block only when it has drifted. `--check-only`
  revalidates without writing. Writes are atomic, so an interrupted run leaves no
  half-written file — just rerun it.
* If a stage fails, the log/report names the stage, the cause and the next action.
  Common cases:
  - *hook returns 409 / "working tree is not clean"* — tracked files are modified.
    Review with `git -C /home/rehmanahmed diff` and commit or restore deliberately.
    For `setup_Deploy.py` itself use `--restore-installer-file`.
  - *wrong origin or branch* — the installer refuses and changes nothing; rerun with
    `--set-origin` / `--switch-branch` once you have confirmed it is right.
  - *dependencies failed* — the report contains pip's own error; fix it and rerun.
  - *WSGI file missing or different name* — the installer prints the block to paste
    and refuses to guess; pass `--wsgi-file` with the exact path from the Web tab
    (needed for custom domains), or `--create-wsgi-file` for a brand-new app.
  - *something looks wrong after a change* — every replaced file is in
    `<checkout>/instance/setup/backups/<timestamp>/` (with a `manifest.json`).
* Two installers cannot run at once: the second exits with the lock file
  (`<checkout>/instance/setup/setup.lock`) explained. It does not delete the lock.
* It never rolls back or restores the live database, never runs the app against the
  production DB as a "check", and never claims success for an unverified step.

### Manual setup (reference — `setup_Deploy.py` performs these steps)

AMS site: https://rehmanahmed.pythonanywhere.com/

The manual procedure is kept here as documentation of what the installer automates and as a fallback for an account where automation is unavailable.

First merge this change into the branch you deploy (normally `main`), then
install or update **this** repository on PythonAnywhere. The server checkout's
`origin` must be `rizwanahmedsora9-pixel/AMS`, and its current branch must match
`AMS_DEPLOY_BRANCH`. Do not reuse the other application's checkout or secret.
Configure the Web tab virtualenv and install `requirements.txt` into it.

The production checkout lives directly in `/home/rehmanahmed`, with no `AMS`
subfolder. PythonAnywhere home directories already contain account files, so
`git clone ... .` usually cannot work. For this first installation only, run
in a **PythonAnywhere Bash console**, after the changes are merged:

```bash
cd /home/rehmanahmed
# Stop if this home directory already belongs to a Git checkout.
if git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Existing Git checkout: stop and inspect it before continuing."
else
    git init &&
    git remote add origin https://github.com/rizwanahmedsora9-pixel/AMS.git &&
    git fetch origin main &&
    git checkout -b main --track origin/main &&
    printf '\n# Deployment-only home checkout: ignore unrelated untracked account files\n*\n' >> .git/info/exclude
fi
```

Do not force checkout or delete account files if Git reports a collision.
The local exclude rule keeps unrelated home files from blocking deployment;
tracked AMS files are still checked for edits. This is a deployment-only
checkout: new untracked files are ignored, so do development in a separate
checkout. Never run `git clean -fdx` here—it could erase account data.

Use `/home/rehmanahmed` for both Source code and Working directory in the
Web tab, `/home/rehmanahmed/.venv` for the virtualenv, and map `/static/` to
`/home/rehmanahmed/static`. Create the virtualenv with a Python version matching
the Web app, for example:

```bash
cd /home/rehmanahmed
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. In a PythonAnywhere Bash console, generate a **new**, server-only secret:

   ```bash
   cd /home/rehmanahmed
   mkdir -p instance
   (umask 077; python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))' > instance/deploy_secret.txt)
   ```

   The uploaded root-level `deploy_secret.txt` was tracked in Git. Removing it
   does not erase history: consider it exposed and replace it in any other
   webhook that shared it. Never commit the new value or paste it into chat.

2. In **Web → WSGI configuration file**, preserve any required host setup,
   then load AMS like this (assuming the checkout is `/home/rehmanahmed`;
   adjust the repository path if you cloned it elsewhere):

   ```python
   import os
   import sys

   sys.path.insert(0, "/home/rehmanahmed")
   os.environ["AMS_WSGI_FILE"] = "/var/www/rehmanahmed_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py"
   os.environ["AMS_DEPLOY_BRANCH"] = "main"
   os.environ.setdefault("SQLITE_JOURNAL_MODE", "DELETE")
   os.environ.setdefault("AMS_HTTPS", "1")
   from wsgi import application
   ```

   Use the exact WSGI filename shown in the Web tab (custom domains can differ).
   Do not point `AMS_WSGI_FILE` at the repository's `wsgi.py`. If your existing
   setup uses a custom `APP_DB_PATH`, preserve it and back up that database.
   The hook does not change, delete, or copy database files.

3. Click the Web tab's **Reload** button once. Open `/deploy/health`; it should
   say the hook is reachable. This is only a reachability check, not proof that
   Git, secrets, or reload permissions are configured correctly.

4. In **rizwanahmedsora9-pixel/AMS → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**:
   - Payload URL: `https://rehmanahmed.pythonanywhere.com/deploy`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Secret: copy the new server file's contents privately into GitHub.
   - Events: **Just the push event**; keep SSL verification enabled.

5. GitHub's signed ping should return `pong`. After a push to the deployed
   branch, inspect **Recent Deliveries** for `Deployed <commit>; WSGI reload
   requested`, then verify the app and PythonAnywhere logs. These changes are
   currently on the Arena working branch; pushes here do not deploy `main`
   until merged. No live deployment has been performed by adding this code.

### Behaviour and troubleshooting

- Optional `AMS_DEPLOY_SECRET_FILE` overrides `instance/deploy_secret.txt`.
  Set environment variables before importing `wsgi` and reload after changes.
- Wrong branch, deleted branch, and non-push events are ignored. Missing
  secrets return 503; bad signatures return 401; malformed JSON returns 400.
- Local changes, a wrong checkout branch, or a concurrent deploy return 409.
  Resolve the cause manually, then redeliver from GitHub. The hook never
  stashes, resets, or discards server edits. Diverged branches fail safely.
- Git commands have timeouts and cannot ask for interactive credentials.
  For private repos, configure read access on the server separately. GitHub
  may time out before a slow synchronous pull completes: check server logs
  before redelivering. There is no background queue or automatic retry.
- Deployment errors go to PythonAnywhere's error log, not public status
  pages. GET `/deploy`, `/deploy/health`, and `/deploy/status` reveal no paths,
  secrets, or Git logs. Reload failure returns an error even if code pulled.
- Dependencies are **not** installed by the hook. Install changed requirements
  manually and reload. AMS applies its existing migrations on startup; take
  a database snapshot before releases with schema changes. There is no
  automatic rollback or database backup in this hook.
- The webhook is production WSGI-only; `python main.py` does not mount it.

### What is covered by tests, and what still needs a real server

Automated tests (`tests/test_setup_deploy.py`, run with the rest of the suite) cover,
in temporary directories with local Git remotes and scripted pip/HTTP — no GitHub or
PythonAnywhere call is ever made and `/var/www` is never touched:

* fresh install, home-directory bootstrap with account files preserved and the `*`
  exclude rule in place, idempotent rerun;
* installer-file collision archived before checkout, colliding home file backed up,
  non-home checkouts excluding only the installer file;
* dirty tracked files, wrong origin, wrong branch: refused and left untouched, with
  `--set-origin` / `--switch-branch` as the explicit remedies;
* missing interpreter, incompatible virtualenv version, pip failure (transient
  retried a bounded number of times, permanent not), missing imports;
* existing secret preserved and permissions tightened, explicit rotation, exposed
  root-level secret quarantined, and no secret or token ever reaching the log,
  report, state file or console;
* custom WSGI content and a custom `APP_DB_PATH` preserved, hand-written AMS import
  adopted as a comment, another application's WSGI file refused, generated block is
  valid Python with exactly the required variables;
* API and webhook stages falling back to printed manual steps without a token, an
  API refusal changing nothing, bounded HTTP retries, the concurrent-run lock, and
  `--check-only`/`--dry-run` writing nothing at all;
* the pre-existing repository suite (including `tests/test_deploy_hook.py`) still
  passing.

Still to be verified on the real account, because no automated test can prove it:

* whether the **free** PythonAnywhere plan allows the documented webapp / static
  files / reload API calls (the manual Web tab steps are the fallback), and whether
  the account may write `/var/www/<domain>_wsgi.py`;
* a real signed GitHub push → `git pull --ff-only` → WSGI reload, confirmed by a
  `200` in *Recent Deliveries*;
* the exact Python version available in the Web tab versus the console used to
  create the virtualenv (the installer warns when they differ).

## Tools

Nothing under `tools/` is imported at runtime. Start with:

```bash
python tools/consistency_report.py          # read-only integrity
python tools/health/preflight_check.py      # blockers that stop new sales
python tools/predator_truth_engine.py --db instance/ahmed_cement_v44_fresh.db --check
```

Repair scripts in `tools/repair_controlled/` require `--confirm` and take a
backup first. See `tools/README.md`.

---

## Remaining work (real, not the old P0 list)

These are the gaps that still match the **current** tree:

1. **Deployment activation** requires PythonAnywhere and GitHub setup and a
   real push/reload check (see "Deployment" above).
2. **`User.password_plain`** still exists for legacy rows. Successful login
   upgrades to `password_hash` and clears plaintext. Rotate any account that
   has never logged in since the hash-only era.
3. **`_WIPE_BACKUP_ENABLED` is `False`.** Granular wipe in Settings does not
   auto-file a DB copy (the deployment hook also makes no backups). Take a
   snapshot before a wipe.
4. **Sale POST idempotency** is tested, but unkeyed double-submit uniqueness
   is still a product choice (payload hash + key). Do not rely on the browser
   alone.
5. **Scale:** list pages that embed every client in the combobox grow with
   client count; `/api/clients/search` exists for a lazy picker if payloads
   get large.

Do not restore the deleted audit markdown. If a new defect is found, file it
against **this** code (repro + pytest), not against August 2026 notes.

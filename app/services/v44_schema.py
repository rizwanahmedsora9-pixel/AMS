The v4.4 design is intentionally kept independent from the legacy ORM tables.
A new installation starts from the checked-in SQL schema and never imports the
old/live database.  The legacy ORM tables are created afterwards as a temporary
compatibility surface so the existing Flask screens remain usable while their
queries are moved to the v4.4 names.

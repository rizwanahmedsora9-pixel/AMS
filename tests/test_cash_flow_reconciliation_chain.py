"""End-to-end tests for the daily Cash Flow reconciliation workflow:

1. Pick a date range ending on day X -> tiles show closing for X.
2. Save physical cash for day X.
3. Any period starting X+1 opens with that physical count AUTOMATICALLY.
4. The carry-forward keeps rolling through days without a count.
5. Saving a reconciliation while display filters are active must still
   store the FULL (unfiltered) closing, not the filtered one.
